# Python projects
Various personal programming projects on Python.
They are all meant to be opened with an IDE to make some tests of your own, and maybe try to change the code slightly and see what happens.

If you have any question about the codes, I would be very happy to answer it at anthony.frion@imt-atlantique.net
